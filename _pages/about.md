I am excited to kick off another chapter of my life to work on AI-based Cardiac Image Computing with academic partners [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), and industrial partners including #NVidia, #Circle Cardiovascular Imaging, and #Conavi Medical.
My PhD is supervised by [Professor Greg Slabaugh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/slabaughgreg.html), and [Dr Martin Benning
](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/benningmartin.html), and I am also a prat of [Queen Mary's Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/). 


 I am working as a Research Assistant at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), [McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/institutes-and-facilities-overview/mcdonald-institute-archaeological-research) on facial expressions recognition in visual arts.

I completed my Master's Degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from [Jeonbuk National University (JBNU), Jeonju, Republic of Korea,](https://www.jbnu.ac.kr/kor/) (2019-2021) with research focused on fundamental Deep Learning and applications of Compuer Vision to Healthcare and Precision Agriculture.

I obtained my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with <b> Magna Cum Laude </b> from [Bahria University Islamabad, (BUIC) Pakistan](https://www.bahria.edu.pk/) (2014-2018). 

## Research Interests
* My primary research interest is to solve vision based problems like Segmentation, Detection, Depth Estimation, and Classification. 
* I also investigate topics related to Deep learning on Mobile Devices, Bioinformatics, Optical Flow and Signal Processing.


## Honors and Awards

During this period I won the following Awards, Scholarships and Internships.
