## Abstract
With unprecedented progress on Internet of Things (IoT), spectrum scarcity becomes even severe with the explosive growth of wireless smart devices. To deal with spectrum scarcity issues, cognitive radio (CR)-enabled IoT has been emerged as a promising solution, which allows IoT devices reusing the underutilized spectrum bands. In this article, we investigate spectrum sensing in CR-IoT, in which full-duplex CR-IoT node can perform spectrum sensing and data transmission concurrently for reducing sensing delay. Two sensing methods are proposed based on multiple high-order cumulants for excavating rich information of the non-Gaussian transmitted signals. Specifically, for the scenarios with a single sensing antenna, we first propose a multiple high-order cumulants-based sensing method (MCS) derived from the likelihood ratio test, which is assumed to be near optimum. The test statistics are derived, respectively, in two cases, i.e., the case only performing sensing and the case performing sensing and transmission simultaneously. Interestingly, the derived two test statistics have same expression, while the corresponding sensing thresholds are different from each other. For the scenarios with multiple sensing antennas, we propose a multiantenna-assisted multiple high-order cumulants-based sensing method (MMCS), which can provide a tradeoff between the computational complexity and sensing performance. We conduct the hypothesis test with Hotelling's T 2 -statistic and derive the corresponding sensing threshold. Theoretical performance evaluated by detection probability and computational complexity of the proposed methods are analyzed. Additionally, extensive simulations are provided, which show both the proposed methods can counter the adverse effects of noise uncertainty, and MCS has superiority over MMCS in terms of sensing accuracy.
