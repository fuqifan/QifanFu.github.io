## Abstract
Covert communication, which can hide the communication behavior, has great potential in guaranteeing the security of information and transmission terminal to the greatest extent. In this paper, we propose a covert communication strategy based on improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) to increase the covert rate in the Internet of Things (IoT) system, in which the existing signals emitted by other transmitters were used as “Spectrum Shelter” to cover the IoT's communication. Specifically, we analyze the system's achievable transmission rate when the IoT node adopts IGS. Then, the optimal detection threshold and the minimum error detection probability of the warden are analyzed. Next, by jointly optimizing the transmission power and circularity coefficient of IGS, we maximize the covert rate under the constraints of the covertness. Finally, the simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can not only guarantee the covertness, but also improve the achievable covert rate.
